Wellcome to The Lab 👩‍🔬 🖥️ 👨‍🔬

Here we'd gather small or big experiments, testing artifacts or alpha versions of wannabe software tools.
Be kind to your peers and explain breafly on the README the intentions behind the experiment, the steps to run it locally, if it is related with any project and whatever context and references that might be useful.
Also state if it is open for contributions, issues, feedback...or if it is on an early stage work in progress.

Just jot down your thoughts and aspirations. The Lab is intended as a place to experiment, fail, gather and share knowledge.

Roll up, roll up 🎪
