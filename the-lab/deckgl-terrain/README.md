# DeckGL Terrain

This repo is somehow related with the Half Earth project. The aim of it is to test the feasibility of creating dynamic, bounding boxed terrains given an arbitrary pair of coordinates.
Data layers need to be placed on top of the terrain.
Custom lightning and shading are needed (eventually this terrain would need to be export in a 3D printing friendly format ⛰️).
