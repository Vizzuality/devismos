On this meeting with Sergio, we were talk about:

## Our capacity health

I showed him our Frontismos tab on the capacity document. Where we missed more months on advance. We already have some project where we know what is the need. **So we decided to be more explicit about our need and ask for the info we need**. After recap this info we can evaluate if we have to start a hiring process.
 
## Marxan and big projects

**We need to specify very clear the roles needed on the development from the beginning**.

We need to be involved in all phases (design, backend, data). Work together as a team and make decisions taking on account all possible needs.

Prepare scopes and features in advance, work very close to product owner (new role).

## Experiments

I told him what we are going to do and when. Alright!


## Pending topics for next meeting

[ ] How should we report mob programming sessions?
