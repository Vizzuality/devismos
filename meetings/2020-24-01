Do we want to use zeit/now as deploy option?
WE should prepare a webgl workshops (JAvi will start a proposal to share with the team)
why mapbox?: first motivation get vector tiles into the map (open sourced the vector tile spec seemed a good shot)
performance stuff: webgl, vector tiles more performant (interaction, smooth scrolling...), eventually decoding vectors for animations...
why through the Layer Manager?: organized, config driven, and most of the desired interactions are there already.
dependes on the data (vector, geojason) but if are images, raster maybe is not the best solution (maybe the performance is not as good as with vectors maybe leaflet (david)

Rodrigo estated that handling raster stuff on the GPU might be a good idea since idle time could me minor than handling rasters from the CPU
David will do some presentation about infrastructure and the things that we can do depending on the service (carto, mapbox)

Use trase hands off to identify what parts of the code needs to be shared before someone dies (David has a document)

Ed asks for help on GFW it seems that want to build super cool and stuff
