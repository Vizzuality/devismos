# Strategy 2021

TBD

## Purpose

To be a solid, organized and cohesive team, with standardized processes and high quality in our deliverables. Where our work and experience is more visible among the functional areas and also outside the company. We are good developers and we are proud of what we do.

## What's new?

### New documentation page

We created a simple static site using Jekyll where we will centralize all the information and documentation we have. Please, feel free to add more content.

Also, we restructure all the information we have. Some new sections are for instance guidelines, recurrent activities and researches.

### New team organization and new roles

Roles and team organization have been redefined in order to make it more explicit, clear and aligned with the current strategy.

* [The new roles](/frontismos/docs/strategy-2021/roles/index)

### Activities and initiatives directory

As an effort to centralize all the information and let you know about all activities we created a initiatives directory where you can see all the initiatives we are doing, we will do and how we will do.

* [How to create a initiative](/frontismos/docs/guidelines/how-to-create-initiatives/index)

### Recurrent activities

New section where we add more info, goals and structures about what we do on those activities.
