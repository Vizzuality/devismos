# Capacity role definition

**Current responsible**: -

## Responsibilities

- Cover whatever capacity need on the back end group >> voted by all as high
	- Agnieszka note: I would reword this, I understand this as "making sure capacity needs from the BE group are covered"
- Facilitator on the capacity meetings >> voted by all as high
	- Agnieszka note: I assume this would be about "the capacity part of the BE SMO meeting"
- Push people to participate on capacity wise >> voted by some as capacity not high for every one.
	- We need a more clear definition or maybe describe a specific task.
- Listen and looking for a solution to the group need on capacity wise >> voted by all as high
- Point of contact for other functional areas [for capacity issues] >> one vote medium rest are high
	- Ask Tiago before
- Attend to capacity monthly meeting >> 

## Impact
- All projects will be covered on capacity wise >>voted by all as high
	- Andrea note: Maybe too ambitious given that we cannot control all the moving parts. So here we need a more clear definition/approach to what does it mean and how much can we cover.
- Detect possible lacks on capacity for the future. (hiring) >> one vote medium rest are high.
- Detect in advance possible spare capacity. >>  kind of 50% high and 50% low
	- We have to talk about it...
