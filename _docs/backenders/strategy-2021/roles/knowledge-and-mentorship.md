# Knowledge Sharing && mentorship role definition

**Current responsible**: Yulia Belyakova, Andrea Rota

This role definition outlines both the *fuller* domain of responsibilities,
impact and decision-making expectations for the role, as well as the *current
focus* which we tuned during the October 2021 exercise on retrospective
reflection about the initial implementation of the role.

## Current focus

- Facilitate the weekly tech meetings

  - Organize each meeting's agenda in advance, gathering input from colleagues
  - Sustain the meeting with flexible rituals, for example inviting each one to
    share successes, frustrations, learnings and pair programming experiences,
    if any, from the current week
  - Coordinate a lightweight meeting structure that can be felt as a safe and
    inclusive space by everyone
  - Balance personal inclinations towards speaking more or less (because of
    character, tiredness, enthusiasm...)
  - Allow for enough flexibility for occasional impromptu deeper focus on topics
    that end up corralling broad interest during discussions
  - Facilitate essential note-taking in a rotation pattern; the aim should be to
    capture at least essential topics discussed, action points and
    commitments, and strong support for/objections to specific items discussed
  - Wrap up the meetings

## Responsibilities

### Paper work:

- Prepare and coordinate the agenda for Friday meetings, promote technical talks, discussion topics.
- Help with the maintenance of internal guidelines.
- Facilitate and coordinate pair programming sessions

  - Nudge colleagues to incorporate pair programming into daily work when
    possible, useful and appropriate, whether as an impromptu practice or as
    planned/scheduled sessions part of the wider pair programming roulette
    initiatives (backend area, cross-functional areas)
  - Promote sharing during the weekly tech meetings of feedback on any pair
    programming sessions that happened during the week


### Cheer work:
-  Remind people to take notes during meetings.
-  Motivate people to collaborate.
-  Visibility: help with the creation of blog posts.

### Map and communicate skills and solutions: 
-  Assess skills: create and maintain the "BE Skills survey".
-  Assess the knowledge (solutions) that we own or are missing. This will help with who to go to, learning, and growth purposes.
-  Create and maintain the internal "BE solutions document". This document should be a knowledge base for proposals and show: Features (Needs) ⇒ Solutions that we use ⇒ Approx Time that we need + Risks.


## Impact
-  Increase the sense of belonging to the team.
-  Increase collaboration inside the team.
-  Increase collaboration outside the team.
-  Promote better sharing of knowledge.
-  Help reduce feelings of working alone.
-  Support the team.

## Decision making
-  In collaboration with the capacity owner be involved in the advice process when allocating proposals and suggest people allocation based on skills.
