# Strategy priorities for 2021

## Standardization and quality

**NOTE: There will be a conversation among all FA to prioritize all the standardization initiatives. We have a a budget of 50K for the whole year to all FA for standardization.**

**Standardization and quality are our priorities for this year**. We are going to make several agreements and conversations inside and outside the group. For instance, these are some of the topics to cover:

* Project creation (framework and libraries)
* Delivery and deployment
* Way of working on the projects (agile initiative)
* Documentation and guidelines
* Interaction with other functional areas

Why? we think the next will be the **benefits** and also will be **our goals**:

* Reduce the technical debt
* Increase the expertise as a group
* Better efficiency
* Reusability
* Facilitate the rotation and onboarding in the projects
* Resilience in case of leavings
* [Define quality goals for 2021](/frontismos/docs/strategy-2021/quality-goals)


## Visibility and communication

We will create documentation to cover everything what we do, we will do and how we will do. A new role has been created for this, and also it will be a point of contact for the functional areas to support and make initiatives together. For example Skill surveys initiative is part of this.

Goals:

* Be more transparent and explicit
* Reduce the initiatives duplication
* Increase collaboration with other functional areas
* Make more visible our work, knowledge, interests and needs

## Community and knowledge sharing

We created an initiative called "Community and growth" where the main goal was to increase the sense of belonging to the team and increase the internal interactions. We wanted to continue working on it during the year. Some of the goals and benefits:

* Increase the collaboration inside the team
* Reduce the alone feeling
* Better sharing knowledge inside the team
* Solve problems as a group
* Will help on the standardization strategy

## Capacity and hiring

We will cover all the need from the projects in terms of capacity, we have the responsibility to decide when we want to start a hiring process where.

Our goals:

* For this year we want to **hire 2 mid level people** to replace people leavings.
* Creation of **a long term plan of hiring and team growth**.
* Creation of a proper **onboarding guideline for junior profiles**.
* Hire **one junior by the end of this year** (after the onboarding plan has been created).

## Personal growth and paths

We need a plan of growing for the team, where our roles, responsibilities and expectations have been defined and are explicit. We are waiting for the People and Culture initiative where we will participate actively.

* Current and not updated [growing paths]((/frontismos/docs/growing-paths/index))

## Training and innovation

Regarding training there is already a company guidelines about it. We don't expect for this year change something about it.

* [Training budget guideline for 2021](https://vizzuality.github.io/playbook/guidelines/Training-Budget-2021.html)
* [Cost tracker](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tRvRYZ3zhjOtKImu6AFILTDYP1TO4F65Fm_vOj4fnhA/edit#gid=0)
* Slack channel #training-budget

About innovation, it seems not to be the priority for this year. Anyway, we already have in the company a own product called [Landgriffon](https://vizz-trackr.herokuapp.com/projects/177) which could considered our innovation (as a company) for this year.

Anyway, **as always as we get the project requirements, goals and there is enough time and budget we have the space and responsibility to innovate** and improve our knowledge and expertise.
