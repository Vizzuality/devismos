# Pair programming

## Objectives

The pair programming sessions objectives are:
- To share information around developers and doing so avoid silos
- To increase the community feeling

Working together will help us learn, improve and understand other developers better no matter our pair level.

## How it works

On Monday, we assign pairs randomly. The developers are informed of their common interests/skills.  If we have odd number of developers they could work in trios.

The developers are the responsible to schedule a session that week on whatever time fits them best. The pair program time is around 1h.

Activities on the pair program session by preference:
  a) Work on a project
  b) One developer teaches the other something (related interest skills)
  c) Show/demo a project or part of it and ask for feedback
  d) Catch up or talk about frontend issues

At the end of the session or just afterwards the developers should write a brief summary of what they have done. This is shared with the group to improve the process and improve the knowledge base
