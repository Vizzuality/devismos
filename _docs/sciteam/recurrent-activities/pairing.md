# Pair Sharing

**Organiser**: AJ

## Objectives

The pair programming sessions objectives are:
- To share project information and bring down silos
- To give learning and mentoring opportunities
- To increase the community feeling

Working together will help us learn, improve and understand other developers better no matter our pair level.
