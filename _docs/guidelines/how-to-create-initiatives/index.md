# How to create initiatives

## What's the value of defining an initiative?

Having a common agreement on how to define and run initiatives would lead us to a better understanding on where we are and where we aim to be (__simplifying direction__) and to understand who is doing what (__accountability__). 

Taking the time to reflect and refine, through advice, the actions that we want to undertake as a group, could increase the feeling of belonging in the team as everyone would be aware of the path we are walking. 

Find [here an initiative template](/docs/guidelines/how-to-create-initiatives/initiative-template/) that could help you get started with a proposal.

These are the context and steps that would make a clear proposal ðŸ‘‡

## Define (Role)

Every initiative needs to define the __responsibilities__ of the people leading it. What they expect are gonna be the __outcomes/impact__ of this initiative and which would be the __decission making rights__ of the persons leading the initiative.

The defined roles for the active initiatives would be available on the [Roles](/docs/strategy-2021/roles/index/) section of current year strategy.

## Experiment (Proposal)

A set of __goals__ need to be defined. What we want to tackle through this initiative, what's the need that wants to be fullfilled.

Experiments need to have a defined __timeframe__ in which they will happen to be able to reflect/assess afterwards and reiterate in case it is needed.

Proposal responsibles need to define the __activities__ they need/plan to undertake in order to achive the initiative goals.

## Communicate and Reflect (Retrospective)


## Outcomes (Guidelines)
