For all of our code bases we are using github as our solution. The main vizzuality repo is located [here](https://github.com/Vizzuality) and you should become a member within your first week at vizzuality. Some other projects are hosted on the clients own organization, you should gain access when you join that project.

Most of our projects are open source, as in open for anyone. There are client exceptions. But some things you should take into account no matter what are these:

1. Never commit secrets or env files to the git repo. If this happens by mistake reach out to someone in the team to clean the history.
2. Always include a .gitignore file in your repo.
3. A good practice is to have a PR template within your repo.
4. For most of our projects we use a changelog as well, this is useful for PM's and your colleagues to track changes.

Some nice to haves:

1. Use versioning, as in releases within github, if possible also check the [vercel](http://localhost:4000/frontismos/docs/guidelines/vercel/) docs and how to set that up if its not there.
2. In some projects we use a dedicated project dev channel on slack, where we are integrating github. This is not a requirement but great to track changes within your project.
