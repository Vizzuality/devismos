### Atendees
Javi Abia, Barrenechea, Tomas, Dani, Pablo Pareja, Ed Brett, Inga, Maria, Andres, Clemment

## Capacity
Ed is leaving the company üôÉ
LandGriffon and Marxan are starting soon. Do we need to hire and which profile?
Is Tomas enough on GFW?

A hiring process would take two months.

Ed is main on GFW, LandGriffon and supporting Marxan.
 - **LandGriffon**. Nothing needs to be done on frontend until June
 - **GFW**. Right now it seems calm. But someone needs to be onboraded, until January could be a good moment to onboard. W need a volunteer.
	Tomas will take the lead on the conversations.
	Someone needs to get onboarded and use 25% of her time to it.

 - **Marxan**. We'll talk about it next Tuesday 
	
Projects status checkout:
Pablo is not gonna be available until end January.
  - Needs: 
	  - Tomas and Maria will handle the ReFed deploy since Barre is not gonna be available until 11 January.

Next year:
- Earth dashboard (needs 1 person 100%)
- GFW (1 person 100%)
- Marxan (1 person 50%?)
- Resource Watch (1 person 50%?)

Allocations:
 - LandGriffon: Inga, Maria
 - Summary 2020: Maria & Alvaro?
 

## Working Groups

## Quality 
*Responsible: Cl√©ment*

Resume of meeting with Sergio regarding Quality.

Front End needs to define quality from project and client perspective (see below).

Next quality meeting will be on December the 3rd. Cl√©ment can not attend, Tomas will go instead.

### Quality for the front-end team

_This is a summary of the discussions about what do we think quality means and what can we do to improve it in the coming months._

Our definitions of quality for the the two pillars are:

- Quality of the product:

Technically, a project with good quality is a project that is maintainable and scalable (in case of long-term contracts). It‚Äôs also a project where we have procedures in place to reduce the number of bugs and prevent them from getting back. We don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs possible to deliver a ‚Äúbug-free‚Äù experience.

Having good estimates, sticking to the scope and delivering on time also affect the quality of the final product. We think that poorly estimated or out-of-scope features often get rushed, and as such, delivered with a lower quality: less maintainable and scalable, and more prone to bugs.

- Quality from the stakeholders‚Äô point of view:

For our users, we think that a quality product is when it matches their needs (serves the purpose), it is stable, consistent and simple to use, it looks good, and finally, it is accessible and works well on their devices (performant and responsive).

For out clients, we think think that the same characteristics apply, and that in addition, it is a high quality product when the final implementation matches what was presented to them (especially the design) and that they feel listened to when they provide feedback.

- - -

In order to build products with high quality, we‚Äôd like to propose the following plan for our FA and suggestions for the others:
- We‚Äôll transition new projects to typed languages such as Typescript to avoid common code errors
- We‚Äôd like to make unit tests mandatory for every new features that is implemented
- We‚Äôd like to have at least two front-end developers working in each project so they can review each other‚Äôs work
- We‚Äôd like new contracts to account for the time dedicated to writing tests: though we think it will save time on the long term, there is an impact for the initial development phase
- We‚Äôd like follow-up contracts to explicitly dedicate a part of the budget to technical debt, when the first one was rushed in
- We‚Äôd like the scope to be kept, or if it evolves, to contain the same amount of work as initially planned
- We‚Äôd like Vizzuality to consider hiring a QA role to help us with testing the live products and identify bugs before the client does so
