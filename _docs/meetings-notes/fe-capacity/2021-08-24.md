# Meeting notes

- Climate Watch (less work than expected for the new phase coming).
- BD + Frontend are going to start a guide about how will BD will work with proposals and capacity.
- No need to get more freelancers now.
- Hiring process - ideally to get 2 profiles (mid and jun).
- We need a better understanding of how the company deals with resources and targets to be able to build the team accordingly.
