# Today’s agenda

- Updates on the following projects:
 	 - The two Mongabay projects (Pablo and Clement)
	 - OTP and Marxan (Barre) 
	 - Prep (David)
- New project coming soon

# Meeting notes

- Prep - Have 2, 3 days of work left (no concerns).
- Marxan - David will help here in April, tough deadline as we are depending on the API.
- Mongabay Data Journalism Tools improvements - Clement: contract hasn't been signed yet, no issues to meet the deadline (2 or 3 days of work left).
- Mongabay Reforestation - Pablo working on it, not big concerns yet but it’s going to exceed the capacity expected for it
- OTP - Almost done, not big concerns.

Need to speed up the hiring process, we are quite short on big projects such as Restor, Landgriffon, Marxan, ReFed, Ocean Watch... . If we don't speed up the process there is a possibility of getting the front-ends when our workload is higher. This is a huge risk for projects and onboarding itself.

We’ve got “happy to proceed” in another project. We still don’t know anything about it but if it starts in about two, three months, we may have to outsource

We need to expose how delays from other areas affect our capacity planning - María to work on this
