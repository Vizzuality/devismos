# Capacity Meeting Agenda (23rd February)

No new projects or phases announced this week, so in today’s meeting, we will check the state of projects we are working on to see if everything is going as expected (no need to go trough all of them, just share any update or concern). 
We have pending - restor.eco and US Resilience.

- David will jump on Marxan for at least two weeks to help backend there. 
- María will take over part of Prep to release David a bit.
- US Resilience current phase - Dani finished it.
- US Resilience next phase - still waiting for client (not FE assigned to it).
- Ocean’s Watch could be heavier than expected, Andrés may need some help in few months.
- Restor.eco - waiting for the client say about the new proposal. If we get the project, Clement will be ok for the first phase with Toma’s help but we will need to onboard two more people in March for the following phase. 
- Layer manager -  David will finish the migration this week but we will need to assign the remaining tasks from phase 1.
- Tomas and David - Define what kind of profiles we need to hire by the end of this week.
