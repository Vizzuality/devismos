# Meeting notes

- No news in Restor about a new phase. Currently new request from client regarding last contract (around a week of work or so). If there are no news, Clement will help in LandGriffon when he finishes.
- Pablo is finalising his tasks in RW and will move to ECF by the end of the week.
- Simao - María will talk to Sebastian to extend him an offer 
- Abdul - We can’t hire him as an intern because he is not at university or official institution. We still would like to give him the opportunity to join Vizzuality so next steps will be to send him a code challenge where we can test his actual level and develop a plan to train him while he is with as in a “probation period”. Pablo will talk to Sebastian to move this forward
- For the next capacity meeting it would be great if we all can do a reflection of the projects we are working on and what will be our ideal situation (fill in [this doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1d6Tw3KepfMD6cLDooMf8e3sp357CToTtgLAFpzNoip4/edit)). 

For example:

  #### Mi situation

  - I'm working on this project_1 alone dedicating 90% of my time
  - I'm also taking care of project_2 and project_3 when something new comes up

  #### My ideal situation
  
  - Having at least one person to help me in project_1 (30% of its time) so I can dedicate just 70% of my time and focus myself on my role, other projects, or any other thing
  - Continue with project_2 
  - Someone to take over project_3 as I’m not getting anything from it, and this new profile could benefit from its chellenges whereas I don't have that much time.
  - I would like to join this project or this kind of project because of my interest, career path...
