- Leticia Platform
- Aquaculture Kenya for Conservation International 
- Mangroves and Waterbirds updates
- Marxan
- Landgriffon

# Notes

 - Restor is in the process to get a freelance. So far, no one is available. Tomas will have more time from next week onwards.
 - Miguel B. will participate in the technical report/ scope for Leticia Platform.
 - David will be very busy with Landgriffon, potentially look for a freelance to take care of Mangroves back-end (María to check with the back-end team).
 - Marxan is in the same situation as last week (Miguel missing endpoints to be able to carry on with the front-end)
 
 Extra discussion: 
 - Soils will need a developer next week just for a couple of hours (María to get more info, potentially Javi, Clement or María will cover this).
 - Hiring - Misalignment with the type of profiles we need in the team (junior, junior high, mid), we decide to send the code challenge to Junior profiles as well.
 - Eltiempo project - They need a map component for their application (application in Nuxt)
