# Notes

- Andrés will take care of environments configuration and layer manager updrade, he will be at full capacity during July, Aug, and Sep.
- Pablo to help in Marxan for 2 weeks until Vikings needs him (last week June - first July).
- Mangroves - No green light to proceed. Deadline not set in stone. Data delays. Open to new deadline. No updates. David I. won't be able to make the back-end if it takes too long to start.
- RW and Land Watch - We need estimations and dates of development.. Hard to allocate people at this moment. Andrés to keep taking care of that.
