# Agenda

1. Check April’s capacity (estimations and reality, it’s already filled so feel free to change anything you think is not accurate - https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1qhcJ6yD-nJW4AmVreqr_i25sxQF4Xw1CJy9_tMX77Rk/edit#gid=858340762)
2. We need to decide when is best to allocate time for the second part of the front-end retro.
3. Planning sheet needs some love (please try to update it before the meeting)
4. I’ll like to have an update from all of you on current projects (if you can’t attend the meeting you can reply with the update here - https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1YDqgJ0yHJetG5oYeaTI50NWGXsg3BenBNZ4Y7zCxapU/edit#gid=518425696)
5. We’ve just started with the hiring process it would be great to know who can spare capacity and interest in helping with any part of it to create a document for hiring/onboarding purposes and it would be great if we can take a look at it today instead of waiting to frontismos meeting on Friday

# Meeting notes

1. Just two projects needed an update
2. We will decide this next week as we will have more info about our availability for the incoming weeks
3. Updated (Mars new phase was discussed after our meeting, Restor next release will be discussed later in the week)
4. Tomas will look for candidates when needed

Overal concerns: 
- Marxan got two freelancers for the back-end so is expected a lot of work to do in the following weeks just for Miguel, David will help him (depending on WEP, Mangroves, and Mars).
- OW and RW are happening at the same time - Andrés is the only developer for both of them (heavy workload)
- Prep - Close the contract today
- Layer manager - After reviewing the proposal, the budget for developers decreased, Álvaro, Miguel, and David will finalize the first phase (migration to TS)
- Mangroves - Proposal sent for a new phase, tough deadline
- Landgriffon - Starts in June, no need for help for scaffolding and the first part of the project. David will be working in Mangroves (if it happens), Mars and Landgriffon so he may need support (not available in the current team)
- Vikings - internal kick off today 
- Half-Earth - Javi will be ok for now having less support from Álvaro 
- Climate Watch and Trase - not much to do, a new phase may come but later in the year so no big concerns
- Mongabay Restoration project - Pablo working full time, it will be done by the end of next week 
- Earth dashboard - will end in July more or less
- Waterbirds - New estimation for a login system. David will take or the back-end and María of the front-end if we get the approval

María will check with the executive team to hire an extra person
