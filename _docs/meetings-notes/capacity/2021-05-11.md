# Meeting notes

- Still pending on Mangroves new phase (waiting for the client to give a response). If we get it, it will impact our capacity a lot from now till July (high risk).
- David will review if he needs a freelance to help him on Landgriffon, as Javi could help him just until July.
- Leticia Platform will need a front-end for consultancy (~2days, potentially Pablo, to confirm depending on Earth Dashboard). 
- Tomas currently working on an "onboarding document" for new people, to be reviewed by the team in the incoming weeks.
- For freelancers - Still to define how we want to work with freelancers in case we need to.
