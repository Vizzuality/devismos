# Operational needs

## Operations

Everybody will spend a **5% of our time on operations** as minimum ([Frontismos](/frontismos/docs/recurrent-activities/frontismos-meetings) and [Capacity meeting](/frontismos/docs/recurrent-activities/capacity-meetings)).
And could increase until **20% of our time on operations** in some cases. For instance the organizational roles, team retrospectives and other very specific activities.

## Vercel

[More info](/frontismos/docs/guidelines/vercel) about why and how we use [Vercel]() as a development tool. To take on account:

- Until 10 team members
- Cost of **10$/month per member** and a little amount for server maintenance. Currently **110$/month**. NOTE: we have a special price.

## Computers renovation

**Pending to define**. At this moment, there is not a guideline covering this topic. For now, whatever need in terms of computers and logistic need we have to make a conversation with Operations (Liuba).
