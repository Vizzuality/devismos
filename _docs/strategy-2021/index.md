### New documentation page

We created a simple static site using Jekyll where we will centralize all the information and documentation we have. Please, feel free to add more content.

Also, we reestructure all the information we have. Some new sections are for instance guidelines, recurrent activities and researches.

### New team organization and new roles

Roles and team organization have been redefined in order to make it more explicit, clear and aligned with the current strategy.
