# Project Management

## What we commit to


- Review carefully every deliverable associated with a project and provide feedback if needed before is shared with the client.

- Facilitate and make understandable (for non technical people) our technical evaluations and decisions.

- Be explicit about development status of the project. Needs and expectations.

- Follow the agreed [agile framework](https://vizzuality.blogin.co/posts/agile-framework-proposal-for-consent-122428).


## What they commit to



- Facilitate trans functional areas interactions.

- Monthly report on the state of the project.

- Recurring scope check-in.

- Before a project starts keep the development start date updated.
