# Community and Growth role definition

**Purpose**: To increase the sense of belonging in the FE team and avoid feelings of isolation/silos whilst we learn from one another.

**Current responsible**: Pablo Pareja Tobes

**Timeline**: June - September _(both included)_

## Responsibilities (& Decision Making Rights)

* **Frontismos Agenda **
  * Reminder to gather ideas with some time in advance
  * Share official agenda on Thursdays (one day prior to the meeting)
* **Pair programming **
  * Define the pair programming pairs/trios weekly on Mondays and sent a message to #frontismos with the results
  * Add a Zapier hook so that feedback submissions are notified on Slack (frontismos channel) ✔️
  * Encourage people to submit feedback about their pair programming sessions
  * First basic data analysis and presentation of the feedback compiled so far.
* **Knowledge pills** (projects' learnings sharing)
  * Put together a workflow to share learnings that we make as part of our daily work in projects. (I'll liaise with Clément for this since it may be related to the Quality role as well)
* **Physical get-together**
  * Start planning out our first front-end get-together
* **“Pulse of the team”** monthly survey 
  * Carry out 4 surveys including several questions to take the pulse of the team on topics such as: sense of fulfillment, sense of community, level of satisfaction with projects, etc… The results from each of these monthly anonymous surveys will be presented during the frontismos meetings on Fridays.

## Impact

by the end of the experiment...
* **Frontismos meeting**: 
  * the team is used to having a clear agenda for the meeting that everybody has contributed to create with time in advance.
* **Pair programming:** 
  * the pair programming sessions are truly embedded into our culture. An initial analysis of the feedback data we’ve gathered so far has been presented and we have identified some changes we could make to the current approach to make it even better or expand it to other teams.
* **Knowledge pills**: 
  * both a workflow and a database/table have been created and team members have already started to use this system to share “coding recipes”.
* **Physical get-together**: 
  * either a first physical meeting has been organized (depending on the COVID situation) or we’ve gathered enough feedback and information to organize it in the short term.
* **“Pulse of the team”:** 
  * once per month the whole team has the chance to not only anonymously express how they’re doing but also get a better understanding of how their peers are.
