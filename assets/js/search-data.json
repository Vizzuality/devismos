    "title": "Team collaboration",
    "content": "In most projects of small to medium complexity and lasting from a few weeks to a few months, backend development is typically done by a single engineer. In more complex or longer projects, a second backend engineer may be part of the team throughout the project or for part of it. Occasionally we may also add freelancers depending on load and schedules. Whether as sole backend engineers or with one or more team members, we work in very close contact with user researchers, designers, frontend engineers, scientist, data engineers and project managers, both through scheduled stand up meetings and sprint planning and retrospectives and by proactively reaching out to plan ahead, discuss functional design, unblock other project members’ work. We may occasionally pair up remotely to work together on specific functional design tasks, to develop features, triage and fix bugs and to seek feedback and advice, although we don’t use pair programming as a daily way of working. We take code reviews both as an opportunity to improve our projects and to learn and mentor. We meet twice a week for two distinct types of team meetings. The first one is an organisational one, dedicated to updating each other and making team decisions broadly related to running a self-managed organisation. The other one is a technical meeting, where we share interesting bits of our daily work. We do also share frustrations, celebrate achievements and in general sustain the team’s growth, while keeping a light-hearted spirit. Once a month that meeting is held together with the frontend engineers team. We try to make sure colleagues don’t feel stuck or concerned about daily work or longer term career development, by reaching out, listening, sharing opinions and experiences, or connecting with other team members who may be best suited to help. We acknowledge that each colleague will have more experience with specific frameworks and technologies and less with others: we don’t do ego trips and we understand that seeking help or advice is a normal part of daily work and of organic team growth. Helping others helps one improve their own knowledge by forcing us to make knowledge understandable and meaningful. Even before recent lockdown times, most of the backend team was fully remote: we expect team members to be able to work independently while keeping project colleagues up to date on progress and blockers and in general to work efficiently and independently wherever they may be working from.

    "doc": "How we work",
    "title": "Our daily work",
    "content": "Depending on project types, we may work on systems ranging from customized CMSes to APIs (mostly REST, less frequently GraphQL). Our APIs typically support SPA frontend apps based on React and NextJS, and a range of data visualization and mapping libraries. We use both monolithic and microservices architectures - again, depending on projects. Our core frameworks are Ruby on Rails, Express, NestJS. Most of us specialize in one framework but we try to develop a basic familiarity with the rest so that we can jump in to help when needed. Most of us are also conversant with Python: the Science team uses it as one of the core languages, and we help maintain microservices that typically use the Flask framework. Especially as some of our projects are expected to evolve through the years, we strive to make our code understandable to our future selves or to colleagues who may work on them in the future. This includes applying architectural patterns, writing essential and accurate documentation in English, and aiming for clean code in general. Testing discipline varies across projects, but we aim to have coverage at least for core features and code paths. We typically design, set up and maintain backend and data infrastructure of our projects, ranging from single VPSes to Kubernetes clusters, across staging and production environments. We test and deploy most of our code via CI/CD pipelines. We may run key tests via git hooks. We may use Docker and Docker Compose for development environments. We run most of our projects on a range of cloud services typically either on the AWS or GCP platforms. We typically take care of database design, operations and performance. We work with relational databases (mostly PostgreSQL), NoSQL (mostly MongoDB), and other data stores such as Redis. Most of our projects are relatively data-intensive, so we expect all team members to have or develop a strong command of advanced data management techniques. In some projects our work may intersect with that of scientists and data engineering. We design and operate ETL pipelines and occasionally help with ML workflows. We expect this to become an increasingly central part of our work in larger projects. We expect team members to take ownership of projects beyond the backend area, by proactively working with project teams and clients to make sure that the data, API and infrastructure parts of projects effectively support each project’s business requirements. By virtue of our ownership of the foundational layers of most projects, we expect team members to provide clear, thoughtful and accurate advice to the other functional areas about alternatives for the implementation of major features, with special attention to performance, developer ergonomics, operational costs, ongoing maintenance and possible future evolution. Occasionally we collaborate with the Business Development team on project proposals. We may write the backend-specific parts of proposals, estimate scope, validate budgets. ",

Many times, when an engineer joins a project, they don’t have all the information available at hand, and they need to interrupt another engineer to gather all the information they need to complete their work. As we all know, interruptions are a source of stress and usually cause unexpected delays in engineers’ work. This OKR aims at standardizing project onboarding practices, with the aim of reducing the number of interruptions in BE daily work. We have identified a series of practices that should be done for every Vizz project, no matter the size, in order to ensure a smooth onboarding process for anyone joining the project. All of the following items should be documented somewhere easily accessible in the project repository (README, wiki, or other convenient structures): . | Documentation for the flow of deployment of the project; | Project credentials and access keys stored in Vizz’s LastPass shared folder. | Project README with local development environment setup instructions up-to-date. | CI (optional) and CD (mandatory) processes must be set up. | . How to measure . Assessing if a project complies to the guidelines defined above is a simple true/false check whether all of the items above have been completed or not.

    "title": "Objective 2: Reduce production incidents",
    "content": "Another clearly identified source of interruptions and stress are production incidents. Production incidents sometimes require engineers to drop everything they’re doing at whatever point in time, to fix such issues. These incidents also impact our reputation with clients, partners or users, leaving them with a sense of lack of quality in our work. Though we know it won’t be possible to completely eliminate such incidents, we can try our best to reduce them, resulting in not only happier clients/partners, but also less stressed engineers and improved overall user experience. How to measure . We have thought about different ways of measuring this. One option could be to drink from the information already available in the PM tools we use across projects (PT, Jira, Asana, etc). We could count the number of incidents per month for each project, and measure the evolution of such incidents. This is not ideal, because: . | some projects are not prepared for this or don’t have this information | the number of incidents might be a misleading metric (1 severe incident is worse than 2 minor incidents) | Bugs might not necessarily match to production incidents (though we might want to track both, depending on the project and client). | . An alternative way of measuring this would be to look at time trackers for maintenance tasks across projects. This has the advantage of using information we already have to account for, and it provides a more accurate way of measuring the outcomes of this OKR. Any of the alternatives above would probably require PMs assistance in the categorization of the severity of the incidents. Also, we need to take into account that sometimes clients have direct access to the PM tools we use, and might create bugs or production incidents that later we might conclude are not in fact bugs or production incidents. This is another task where the assistance of PMs could be really useful. Pain points: . Hard to measure . ",

    "content": "It’s a pretty well known fact that tested code is a proven path to higher quality. Vizz projects sometimes lack testing coverage, and the BE team would like to make an effort to change this. Testing requirements need to adapt to the size of the project - smaller projects sometimes imply don’t have enough resources to do proper testing, and larger projects benefit the most from the long term impacts of proper testing. So we propose to use BD’s project categorization as a way to categorize the testing requirements for the projects we work on: . | Small projects: 0% test coverage - we can assume most of the testing will be done manually. | Medium projects: 50% test coverage - includes manual testing + aim at covering the critical paths of the project (data processing pipelines, etc - might vary according to the project). | Big projects: 80% test coverage - includes manual testing + critical path testing + non-critical path tests and tests for any bugs that come up, to ensure they don’t happen again. | . How to measure . To be measured on a project-by-project basis - older projects might take some time to fit into these guidelines, so for now we will focus especially in applying these practices in the new big projects that we have coming up.

The challenge associated with front end development is that the tools and techniques used to create the front end of a website change constantly and so the developer needs to constantly be aware of how the field is developing. The objective of designing a site is to ensure that when the users open up the site they see the information in a format that is easy to read and relevant. This is further complicated by the fact that users now use a large variety of devices with varying screen sizes and resolutions thus forcing the designer to take into consideration these aspects when designing the site. They need to ensure that their site comes up correctly in different browsers (cross-browser), different operating systems (cross-platform) and different devices (cross-device), which requires careful planning on the side of the developer. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Front-end_web_development .

Activities on the pair program session by preference: a) Work on a project b) One developer teaches the other something (related interest skills) c) Show/demo a project or part of it and ask for feedback d) Catch up or talk about frontend issues .

    "title": "Objective 1: Reduce the number of preventable bugs with Typescript",
    "content": "We believe there’s no such thing as building bug-free code. Nevertheless, we believe a certain number of bugs are easily preventable through the use of static analysis tools. Such tools analyse the code and detect possible bugs through heuristic. They have very little to no cost in terms of time (configuration, use, etc.), so we believe they are a win-win solution for some of the bugs created during development. One of such tools is Typescript. Typescript is a programming language that can be described as Javascript with types. Types avoid very common mistakes where a variable that is supposed to be of a specific type, or that is supposed to have a specific form gets assigned something different or unexpected. If this were to happen, a typed language such as Typescript would detect the error and notify the developer in their text editor. Typescript is very popular both in front-end and back-end environments. As a matter of fact, the back-end team is already using it in a few places. In the front-end, we have only used it sparsely until now, principally because of the lack of training and guidance. Yet, the front-end team agreed at the end of 2020 that we would want all the new projects to eventually be written in this language, given the benefits the few projects we tested it in got. Our objective then is the following: we would like all new projects to be written in Typescript. To measure the success of this objective, we think it will be as easy as looking back at the new projects we got, and checking whether they were written in Typescript or not. To help with the transition, we believe the pair-programming and mob-programming sessions the internal community initiative (lead by Daniel F. and Alvaro) is providing are a good place to start. At the end of last year, we also held a Typescript workshop to get people more familiar with it. ",

    "title": "Objective 2: Get familiar with testing and expand the number of projects with tests",
    "content": "Another decision the front-end FA took at the end of last year was that we would like to incorporate more tests in our daily work. We believe that in order to create a “testing culture”, we need to start all writing tests at some point. Different types of tests can be done. We believe the easiest ones to start with are unit tests. They refer to tests being written for small pieces of code (usually functions) that have one single purpose. Another type of test is end-to-end testing, where the navigation flow and interaction of the user is simulated to detect user interface and more global bugs. Between these two types, we would encourage the first one: unit tests. End-to-end testing is very relevant in the context of quality through the eyes of the user, but does require consequent time and effort. In addition, unit testing encourages the developer to gain a different mindset, one that is writing single purpose and reusable pieces of code. Indeed, only such pieces of code can be properly tested. Some of the team members already have experience with unit testing, and we hope this objective, as with the change to Typescript, can be an opportunity for knowledge sharing. Our objective in simple words is the following: we would like developers to write some unit tests whenever the opportunity arises, and especially when regressions are detected. To measure its success, we would look back at how many active projects have tests and survey the team members to know when’s the last time they wrote some. ",

If this happens by mistake reach out to someone in the team to clean the history. | Always include a .gitignore file in your repo. | A good practice is to have a PR template within your repo. | For most of our projects we use a changelog as well, this is useful for PM’s and your colleagues to track changes. | . Some nice to haves: . | Use versioning, as in releases within github, if possible also check the vercel docs and how to set that up if its not there. | In some projects we use a dedicated project dev channel on slack, where we are integrating github. This is not a requirement but great to track changes within your project. | . ",

    "content": "Definition . Decision-making session to either deal with a complex feature or, as part of the first stages of a project, be able to standardize the opinions of all / most members of the front-end team. There may be some programming included but it is not a requirement. These sessions should be aligned both with the company’s purpose and the front-end team strategy. Duration . It should normally take around 1 or 1 and a half hours. However, the idea is to use that time as efficiently as possible by previously doing individual asynchronous work by the attendees of the session. General objectives . | Gather everyone’s input on the selected topic. Active participation from the whole team is a must. We want these sessions to be 100% inclusive and all attendees should feel they have the time and space to share their thoughts about the topic. | Contribute towards the standardization of the ways of working across the team. Reach a unified vision for the front-end solutions. | Work towards the elimination of knowledge silos across the team | Increase the team cohesion | Create a space for new ideas to pop up | . Outcomes . Even though specific outcomes per session must be defined, at least the following outcomes should be produced: . | A dedicated folder for each specific mob programming session will be created in the Notion “Community &amp; Growth” site | This dedicated folder should at least include the following items: . | Session notes | Decisions made (also documented on the project) | Actions summary (when applicable, e.g. gathering feedback about the session) | . | . Optional outcomes . | Blog-in post describing the session and its outcomes/conclusions. | Session recording (optional but highly encouraged) | . Attendance . Attending a mob session won’t be required but it will be highly encouraged so that the general objectives are more easily met. /However, we should obviously take into account our capacity and projects’ duties before committing to participate in a mob session. We should obviously take into account our capacity and projects’ duties before committing to the participation in a mob session. Frequency . In principle we could aim for a monthly frequency, that way we would have the “Mob session of the month”, allowing enough time for the preparation + follow-up for each of the sessions. This is not a requirement, just something we would be aspiring to. Prerequisites . | Agenda: A simple but clear agenda should be defined several days in advance including session sections with the corresponding expected timings. | Homework for attendees: A list of must-know resources (docs, links, etc) should be defined in advance and shared with the prospective attendees at least one week in advance. That way everybody should have had time to get familiarized with the topic | Questions form (optional) Form including the main questions that will be asked on the mob session. It should be created and shared at least one week in advance also. **These questions would be answered by the other developers and the answers will be accessible to anyone so they can prepare before the meeting. | . Roles . | Note-takers: This role should be assigned prior to the session. Several people should be assigned to this role so that all the effort doesn’t fall on just one person. Each of the note-takers should be assigned to specific sections or items from the session as part of the Agenda. That way we would avoid confusion about who should be taking notes and when. Overall the idea is that everybody should be involved in the note-taking effort. (As an addition to the notes, we could also explore the possibility to automate part of this through recordings and natural language recognition). | Topic Lead Person who is the driving force of the session and initiates the discussion. He/she has written the agenda. This is the person who either knows more about the subject or is designated to start the project and has a broader and more complete background of the topic. | Moderator Responsible to keep an eye on the time of the different sections of the agenda so they fit into the expected duration. Also will ensure the participation of every attendant as much as possible. | . Structure . | Short introduction: 5 mins tops. | Sections: Every question / part of the agenda that requires some decisions. This is divided on: . | Split into groups (2-3) depending on the number of participants: We split the conversation into several groups to gather everyone’s insights | Sharing and further discussion: Some representative of each group shares the decisions and the section is discussed by the whole team | Conclusions: The final decisions/actions are documented | . | Q&amp;A or addendum After all the topics are discussed there might be some time to add some more questions/doubts about the project and solve them. | . Follow-up requirements . | Session Notes review: everyone commits take a look at the notes to see if there was something missing or not accurately portrayed. | . ",

Next quality meeting will be on December the 3rd. Clément can not attend, Tomas will go instead. Quality for the front-end team . This is a summary of the discussions about what do we think quality means and what can we do to improve it in the coming months. Our definitions of quality for the the two pillars are: . | Quality of the product: | . Technically, a project with good quality is a project that is maintainable and scalable (in case of long-term contracts). It’s also a project where we have procedures in place to reduce the number of bugs and prevent them from getting back. We don’t think it’s possible to deliver a “bug-free” experience. Having good estimates, sticking to the scope and delivering on time also affect the quality of the final product. We think that poorly estimated or out-of-scope features often get rushed, and as such, delivered with a lower quality: less maintainable and scalable, and more prone to bugs. | Quality from the stakeholders’ point of view: | . For our users, we think that a quality product is when it matches their needs (serves the purpose), it is stable, consistent and simple to use, it looks good, and finally, it is accessible and works well on their devices (performant and responsive). For out clients, we think think that the same characteristics apply, and that in addition, it is a high quality product when the final implementation matches what was presented to them (especially the design) and that they feel listened to when they provide feedback. In order to build products with high quality, we’d like to propose the following plan for our FA and suggestions for the others: . | We’ll transition new projects to typed languages such as Typescript to avoid common code errors | We’d like to make unit tests mandatory for every new features that is implemented | We’d like to have at least two front-end developers working in each project so they can review each other’s work | We’d like new contracts to account for the time dedicated to writing tests: though we think it will save time on the long term, there is an impact for the initial development phase | We’d like follow-up contracts to explicitly dedicate a part of the budget to technical debt, when the first one was rushed in | We’d like the scope to be kept, or if it evolves, to contain the same amount of work as initially planned | We’d like Vizzuality to consider hiring a QA role to help us with testing the live products and identify bugs before the client does so | .

    "content": "First, a quick example. We will create a new Git repository/project on the SourceHut platform via its GraphQL API. $ cat example.json mutation createRepository($name: String!, $description: String) { createRepository(name: $name, visibility: PRIVATE, description: $description) { id updated owner { canonicalName } } } $ curl -X POST -H 'Authorization: Bearer &lt;token&gt;' \\ -H 'Content-Type: application/graphql' -d @example.json 'https://git.sr.ht/query?variables={\"name\": \"marxan-cloud-ftw\", \"description\": \"Components for the MarxanCloud platform\"}' | jq { \"data\": { \"createRepository\": { \"id\": 12345, \"updated\": \"2020-12-09T10:07:00Z\", \"owner\": { \"canonicalName\": \"~hotzevzl\" } } } } . Although this is a very simple example, we can nevertheless observe some key traits of a typical GraphQL API which are relevant for a review of key differences from REST-ish APIs. | In simplest use cases, GraphQL is “just JSON over HTTP” | . In practice, client and server libraries are needed to do most of the heavy lifting (similarly to client and server implementations of the JSON:API spec), but in essence the interface between GraphQL clients and servers is mostly a pipeline of JSON documents (requests and response) over HTTP: for very simple interactions, even plain requests via cURL will work fine. | Requests typically hit a single “endpoint” | . In this example, the endpoint is https://git.sr.ht/query. This acts effectively as an “entry point” to the entire GraphQL API, through which all the client request are channeled. Meaningful, consistent and elegant URI design, which is typically a core part of a REST API, does not really apply to GraphQL. All the naming semantics are conveyed through the GraphQL payload (above shown as raw GraphQL query, but typically encapsulated in a JSON file which contains both query and variables). In a REST API, a request similar to the example above, to create a new repository, would be done via something like POST /api/v1/repositories, with a JSON payload describing the resource that we are trying to create. | HTTP is used as a “dumb” transport channel | . All requests use a single HTTP verb (typically, POST: GET may be used to query data only, not to mutate data), besides using a single “endpoint”. This is a major departure from the consistent use of key HTTP verbs in REST APIs. | GraphQL is kind of RPC | . In their simplest form, GraphQL queries do indeed feel declarative; for example: . query { me { canonicalName } } . However, they can be augmented with parameters which may describe server-side operations of arbitrary complexity; such as plain filters in the example below (repositories(filter: { count: 2 }): . query { me { canonicalName repositories(filter: { count: 2 }) { cursor results { id, name, updated } } } } . Or stateful cursors for paginated result sets such as in the example below: . query { me { canonicalName repositories(cursor: \"&lt;long string with cursor&gt;\") { cursor results { id, name, updated } } } } . In my view, GraphQL allows to hit a sweet spot between the meaningful manipulation of representations of resources as typically done in REST APIs, and the potential expressiveness and flexibility of RPC interfaces, yet without forcing to work within the complexity of more elaborate RPC systems (for those still having SOAP or XML-RPC nightmares from the 2000s). | GraphQL enforces strongly typed schemas | . Although it is indeed possible to create GraphQL schemas that only use basic scalar types (such as String, Int, Float, Boolean), in practice this would hardly be useful: most often, expressive types are created and composed. Union types, interfaces, enums are commonly used to curate expressive API graphs. “Making impossible states impossible” through strong typing is indeed a major advantage of the GraphQL query language. In the example above, the createRepository() mutation accepts one required string parameter (name) and one optional string parameter (description), and makes use of an enum type for the visibility parameter. Query payloads that don’t validate against the schema are outright rejected (and GraphQL tooling can help to avoid even creating invalid payloads, especially if coupled with TypeScript typing). | Caching is… different | . A major point for GraphQL skepticism, but likely in practice not all that relevant in projects like the Marxan cloud platform. GraphQL queries (as opposed to mutations and subscriptions) could indeed be cached by using the GET-verb endpoint, companion to the POST one normally used (with some caveats). In practice, for authenticated GraphQL APIs where query results may be different for each authenticated user, even this may not be a major issue, especially when combined with application-level caching strategies, which are available at different levels of granularity (from whole-request down to individual fields). Several common caching strategies are implemented in major GraphQL client and server implementations, making it possible to rely on existing best practices and keeping development complexity under control. Moreover, expensive queries that need to be exposed to non-authenticated users could also be made available over ad-hoc REST endpoints, thus allowing to enjoy the benefits of HTTP-layer gateway caching.

    "doc": "Marxan",
    "title": "Some more points to consider",
    "content": "More traits of GraphQL API practices cannot be gleaned from the initial example above. I am briefly outlining here the ones that are, in my opinion, most relevant to the Marxan cloud platform scenario. | Authentication is often kept as a REST subsystem | . This seems to be common practice, and allows to use different established authentication strategies (e.g. password authentication, 2FA, OAuth2, etc.). Once a token or key of some sort is obtained, this can be used in HTTP headers as commonly done in Bearer type authorization strategies or equivalent. | Introspection augments the type system | . In practice, this is often used to provide functionality similar to what OpenAPI interfaces do; in the case of GraphQL, documentation of the whole API graph is consistently done via introspection, so the GraphQL schema serves both as parsing, validation and query processing layer as well as documentation layer (the same may be true in some OpenAPI server implementations, in practice). Documentation on how to use a GraphQL API is typically still needed like with most non-trivial APIs, although the type system combined with introspection and meaningful naming of queries, mutations and parameters provides a convenient core documentation layer. | Authorization | . Fine-grained access control is pretty much equally doable via REST and GraphQL. For example, only allowing users with a specific role to set or modify specific fields, or to set them to specific values under specific circumstances, or to query specific fields. GraphQL may make some access control rules more expressive (for example, by using access decorators in the schema definition) and easier to understand at a glance, although I would argue this is mostly a tooling concern as well as a matter of preference. | N+1 problem | . GraphQL resolvers by default typically traverse a query graph node by node, depth-first and may process each node in isolation, which could easily lead to very inefficient database queries (defaults are actually up to server implementations - this would be a worst-case scenario). GraphQL server implementations may provide, either as core functionality or through a library/module, lazy loading/async/batching functionality which essentially traverses the whole query graph (or parts of it), compiling a query plan and eventually executing this to load data from database through the least possible number of queries (simplifying things a bit here). This pattern (“DataLoader”) may limit the ability to compute/estimate cost of individual resolvers, so in case of very complex query graphs, things will still need to be optimised for a sane balance between query performance and the ability to constrain queries whose computational cost is considered unacceptable for the specific context. | API Versioning | . A common strategy seems to be evolutive versioning, or basically deprecating affected fields (the GraphQL schema description language provides a @Deprecated directive for this) and introducing their eventual replacements, while keeping the deprecated ones in place until it is possible/reasonable to break existing API contracts. | Errors | . Besides sidestepping the semantics of HTTP verbs besides GET and POST, GraphQL also handles errors differently than via HTTP status codes. In practice, client and server implementations take care of error handling similarly to how HTTP status codes would be handled by REST frameworks. Additionally, GraphQL error handling can be granular, for example surfacing different kinds of errors as they apply to different parts of a query. | Federation | . GraphQL APIs for distinct microservices can be federated at the API layer itself (e.g. via Apollo Federation), essentially providing a GraphQL-focused gateway that allows clients to see a single GraphQL API even though parts of its functionality may be provided by independent microservices. We didn’t use nor needed this functionality in Wildlife Insights, but as we are likely going to rely on a small set of microservices for data processing operations, this could be a useful feature for the Marxan cloud platform. We could of course equally do some ad-hoc lightweight proxying of REST requests in the API. ",

    "title": "How to use it using on Vizzuality projects",
    "content": "You can mostfly follow the documentation. And, use Credentials provider which seems to be the one we need. And it works fine but we found two main issues. 1. No possibility to extend the session object. The standard JWT object will have the next format: . { \"user\": { \"name\": \"Juan Palomo\", \"email\": \"yomeloguiso@yomelo.como\", \"image\": \"route-to-image.png\", }, \"acess_token\": \"the-token-generated-from-the-api\", \"expires\": \"expiration-date-given-from-authentication-endpoint\" } . The problem, when we try to create the session it will only response a object with the above format. Whatever additional parameter will be ignored. Our response have the next structure: . { \"email\": \"yomeloguiso@yomelo.como\", \"displayName\": \"Juan Palomo\", \"fname\": \"\", \"lname\": \"\", } . So, displayName, fname, lname and access_token are ignored in the session creation. // session object created by next-auth { \"user\": { \"name\": null, \"email\": \"yomeloguiso@yomelo.como\", \"image\": null }, \"expires\": \"2021-04-07T09:39:33.591Z\" } . You will say, in the documentation seems there is a way to extend the session. It’s true but the paramaters you received are the session object (limited) and the decoded json web token (also limited). Conclusion, you cannot use a complete profile for session creation, at least with Credentials provider. We can live with that, because you can request the profile to the API. But it opens the second issue. 2. We cannot access to original encoded token from the API. The session that you receives in the application is omitting (for any reason) the access_token attribute. So, in your application there is not a way to get the token you need for HTTP request. You need to include Authorization: \"Bearer token\" in your HTTP request using the API and it’s not possible using this method. I also, tried the next: . // _app.js import { getToken } from 'next-auth/jwt'; export const getServerSideProps = async (context) =&gt; { const token = await getToken(context); return { props: { token }; }; . But it also requires to add the option signingKey: process.env.JWT_SIGNING_PRIVATE_KEY, in [...nextauth].js file. The problem is, the JWT_SIGNING_PRIVATE_KEY is used to encode and decode the token in the client. But it seems you cannot use a random key because you will have the next error: . JWSVerificationFailed: signature verification failed . Solution . Creates a custom session object, to do that you have to include this in [...nextauth].js file: ... callbacks: { // Assigning encoded token from API to token created in the session async jwt(token, user) { if (user) { const { accessToken, ...rest } = user; token.accessToken = accessToken; token.user = rest; } return token; }, // Extending session object async session(session, token) { session.user = { ...session.user, ...token.user, }; session.accessToken = token.accessToken; return session; }, }, ... And this is how my Credentials looks like: . // Configure one or more authentication providers providers: [ Providers.Credentials({ // The name to display on the sign in form (e.g. 'Sign in with...') name: 'Sign in with Marxan', // The credentials is used to generate a suitable form on the sign in page. // You can specify whatever fields you are expecting to be submitted. // e.g. domain, username, password, 2FA token, etc. credentials: { username: { label: 'Email', type: 'email', placeholder: 'username@domain.com' }, password: { label: 'Password', type: 'password' }, }, async authorize(credentials) { const { username, password } = credentials; // Request to sign in const signInRequest = await AUTHENTICATION.request({ url: '/sign-in', method: 'POST', data: { username, password }, headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' }, }); const { data } = signInRequest; const { accessToken } = data; // After sign-in, request data user to create session with a complete profile const userRequest = await USERS.request({ url: '/me', method: 'GET', headers: { Authorization: `Bearer ${accessToken}`, 'Content-Type': 'application/json', }, }); const { data: userData } = userRequest; if (userRequest.statusText === 'OK') { const user = { ...userData, ...userData, accessToken }; return user; } throw new Error(data); }, }), ], .
